# Task Manager REST API – Clean Architecture

A RESTful API built with Express.js following a clean, scalable, and backend-focused project structure.  
This project demonstrates real-world backend engineering practices including authentication, authorization, and secure API design.

---

## Features
- Express Router
- Controller-based architecture (MVC)
- RESTful API design
- JSON-based responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Centralized error handling with AppError
- 404 (Route Not Found) middleware
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- Environment configuration using dotenv

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based Authentication (`protect` middleware)
- Role-based Authorization (`restrictTo` middleware) `admin`, `manager`, `user`
- Ownership-based Access Control (project-level implemented)
- Secure middleware chaining for route protection

### 🔎 Advanced Query Features
- Filtering, sorting, pagination, searching implemented on Users, Projects, and Tasks
- Multi-value query support for fields like `role`, `priority`, `status`
- Date comparison filters (`gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt`) supported
- Keyword search for `name`, `email`, `title`, `description` as applicable

---

## Authorization Design

### Roles
- **user** → Can view and work with assigned tasks
- **manager** → Can create and manage their own projects
- **admin** → Full system control (users, projects, tasks)

---

### Auth API
- SignUp for creating new user profile
- Login entry point
- Any authenticate user can Change Password 

---

### Users API
- Only Admin can access user based CRUD api endpoint
- Any authenticated user can access `/me` api endpoint to get own profile and edit name and email only, but admin
- Supports filtering by any existing fields with rational multi-values and aslo with `gte|gt|lte|lt`
- Supports search by `name`/`email`
- Supports sorting (`sort`) and pagination (`page` & `limit`)

---

### Projects API
- Any authenticated user can view projects
- Manager/Admin can create projects
- Manager becomes owner automatically
- Admin can assign or override project ownership
- Only **project owner or admin** can update/delete projects

---

### Tasks API
- Any authenticated user can view tasks
- Supports filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Task creation restricted to project manager of task/admin
- Task update is restricted based on ownership and assignment
- Task delete restricted to project manager of task/admin

---

## Implemented APIs

### Users
- **POST /users** — Create user (Admin only)
- **GET /users** — Get all users (Admin only, supports filtering, sorting, pagination, searching)
- **GET /me** — Get profile of any athenticated user or login user
- **PATCH /me** — Edit profile of any athenticated user or login user
- **GET /users/:id** — Get a particular user (Admin only)
- **PUT /users/:id** — Edit a particular user (Admin only)
- **PATCH /users/:id/reset-password** — Reset password of a particular user (Admin only)
- **DELETE /users/:id** — Delete a particular user (Admin only)

### Users
- **POST /users** — Create user (Admin only)
- **GET /users** — Get all users (Admin only, supports filtering, sorting, pagination, searching)

Example of supported query parameters:
- `search` → name, or email
- `role` → multi-value filter for users (e.g., `role=user,admin`)
- `createdAt` → date filtering using `gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt` (e.g., `createdAt[gte]=2026-01-01`)
- `isActive` → filter active/inactive users (e.g., `isActive=true`)
- `sort` → comma-separated fields (e.g., `sort=role,-createdAt`)
- `page` → page number for pagination (e.g., `page=1`)
- `limit` → results per page (e.g., `limit=10`)

- **GET /me** — Get profile of any athenticated user or login user
- **PATCH /me** — Edit profile of any athenticated user or login user
- **GET /users/:id** — Get a particular user (Admin only)
- **PUT /users/:id** — Edit a particular user (Admin only)
- **PATCH /users/:id/reset-password** — Reset password of a particular user (Admin only)
- **DELETE /users/:id** — Delete a particular user (Admin only)

#### Response Metadata for GET all Users requests
- `results` → number of items returned
- `total` → total items matching filters
- `page` → current page
- `limit` → results per page
- `data` → array of objects

### Projects
- **POST /projects** — Create project (Manager/Admin)
- **GET /projects** — Get all projects (Authenticated users)
- **GET /projects/:id** — Get a particular project (Authenticated users)
- **PUT /projects/:id** — Edit project (Owner/Admin)
- **DELETE /projects/:id** — Delete project (Owner/Admin)

### Tasks
- **POST /tasks** — Create task (Manager/Admin)
- **GET /tasks** — Get all tasks (Authenticated users)

Supports query parameters:
- `search` → keyword search in title, description
- `priority` → single or multiple values (e.g., `priority=high` or `priority=high,medium`)
- `status` → single or multiple values (e.g., `status=open` or `status=open,completed`)
- `createdAt` → date filtering using `gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt` (e.g., `createdAt[gte]=2026-01-01`)
- `sort` → comma-separated fields (e.g., `sort=-createdAt`)
- `page` → page number for pagination (e.g., `page=1`)
- `limit` → results per page (e.g., `limit=10`)

- **GET /tasks/:id** — Get a particular task
- **PUT /tasks/:id** — Edit a particular task (ownership rules in progress)
- **DELETE /tasks/:id** — Delete a particular task (restricted access in progress)

#### Response Metadata for GET all Tasks requests
- `results` → number of items returned
- `total` → total items matching filters
- `page` → current page
- `limit` → results per page
- `data` → array of objects
